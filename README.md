# Climate Factors Contribution Analysis

This project analyzes the individual contributions of various forcing factors (CO2, solar activity, SOx, optical thickness, and Southern Oscillation Index) to global average temperature changes from 1866 to 1914 using a moving window linear regression approach.

## Overview

The analysis aims to model how different climate factors contribute to temperature changes over time. It uses historical data and implements a custom moving window linear regression algorithm to calculate and visualize the contributions of each factor.

## Key Features

- Custom moving window linear regression implementation
- Visualization of factor contributions over time using Plotly
- Analysis of multiple climate factors: CO2, solar activity, SOx, optical thickness, SOI

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```
python climate_factors_analysis.py
```

The script will output visualizations showing the relative contributions of each factor over time.

## Technologies Used

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Plotly
